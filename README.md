### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a senior at University of California, Berkeley, and I am graduating in 2020 Fall, finally! I am pretty interested in Japanese culture(I watch a lot animes). I do not have bunch hobbies, but I do go hiking sometimes, some random coding during my spare time (mostly iOS apps), and play video games.  


### Some of my intersting projects
- I put up a [covid information](https://github.com/rexhanh/Covid_info) app during the summer, but due to Appstore policies, I wasn't able to publish it.

- My robotics class projects [Maze Runner](https://robot-gang.github.io/maze-runner/)
